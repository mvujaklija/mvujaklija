- Hello
My name is Milan Vujaklija and I am MSc Surveying by profession.

I have worked in my profession for 12 years, six of which I spent as the head of the geodetic service.
Since my profession required field work and short absences from home, I decided to make a breakthrough in my career so that I could devote more time to my family. In addition, I reached the point of burnout.

I've always been good at programming so I'm not a total beginner.
I am currently attending a cours for QA & Testing software, and will defend my final project in December 2022.
I chose it because the course is short, the certificate is quickly obtained, and I think it is the best way to enter the world of the IT industry.
In addition, I am learning JAVA for myself on an online platform for the purpose of being a java developer.

If you have any advice feel free to write to me, and wish me luck as I enter a new chapter in my life.
